# What is Armbian? #

Universal operating system for a selection of ARM single board computers. It's more or less pure **Debian / Ubuntu** with dedicated kernel and small modifications to operating system.

Currently supported boards / kernels:

	- Cubieboard 1,2,3				3.4.x and mainline
	- BananaPi / PRO / R1			3.4.x and mainline
	- Cubox, Hummingboard			3.14.x and mainline
	- Linksprite Pcduino3 nano		3.4.x and mainline
	- Olimex Lime, Lime 2, Micro 	3.4.x and mainline
	- Orange Pi						3.4.x and mainline
	- Udoo quad						4.0.8
	- Udoo Neo						3.14.x

## General features: ##
- Debian Wheezy, Jessie or Ubuntu Trusty based. 
- Community backed kernel in most cases with large hardware support and headers. 
- Board / wireless firmware included where needed.
- Build ready â€“ possible to compile external modules.
- apt-upgrade ready for kernel, u-boot and other customizations.
- Distributions upgrade ready
- hostapd ready with optimized configuration and [manually build binaries](https://github.com/igorpecovnik/hostapd)
- ethernet adapter with DHCP and SSH server ready on default port (22) with regenerated keys @ first boot
- SD image is big as actual size (around 1G) and auto resized to maximum size @first boot
- graphics desktop environment upgrade ready, some with hardware acceleration.
- SATA & USB install script included (/root)
- serial console enabled
- root password is 1234. You will be prompted to change it at first login
- enabled automatic security updating and ready for kernel apt-get updating
- login script shows board MOTD with current board temp (if avaliable), hard drive temp, ambient temp from Temper(if avaliable) and battery charge ratio (if avaliable) & actual free memory
- Performance tweaks:
	- /tmp & /log = RAM, ramlog app saves logs to disk daily and on shut-down (ramlog is only in Wheezy, others have default logger)
	- automatic IO scheduler. (check /etc/init.d/armhwinfo)
	- journal data writeback enabled. (/etc/fstab)
	- commit=600 to flush data to the disk every 10 minutes (/etc/fstab)
	- eth0 interrupts are using dedicated core (some boards)

## Where to get Armbian? ##

[http://www.armbian.com](www.armbian.com "Armbian universal operating system")

Armbian is avaliable as SD card image.

[![](http://www.igorpecovnik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/micro_SD-256.png)](http://www.armbian.com)

Note: each image have more download options:

- Separate images for Debian Wheezy, Jessie and Ubuntu Trusty
- [M]irror download
- [R]oot filesystem deb package (for manual upgrading from previous versions)
- Different kernel options and archive with u-boot, dtbs and firmware packages. 

Major difference between old and new kernel is hardware support. They are both stable but older kernel is usually fully supported while in new some things are missing. (audio, HW graphics acceleration, ...)

# How to build Armbian? #

You will need to setup development environment within [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS x64 server image](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/) and cca. 20G of free space.

Build process summary:

- creates development environment on the top of X86/AMD64 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS,
- download proven sources, applies patches and use tested configurations,
- cross-compile universal boot loader (u-boot), kernel and other tools and drivers, 
- pack kernel, uboot, dtb and root customizations into debs,
- debootstrap minimalistic Debian Wheezy, Jessie and Ubuntu Trusty into SD card image,
- install additional packets, apply customizations and shrink image to it's actual size.

Additional clarification:

- **KERNEL_ONLY** - if we want to compile kernel, u-boot, headers and dtbs package only. The output is .tar file in target subdirectory. By default this is output/kernel. 
- **SOURCE_COMPILE** is useful switch when we are building images and we already compiled kernel before. All kernel builds are cached in output/kernel by default until they are removed manually. If we choose this option, we will be selecting one of previously compiled kernels.
- **KERNEL_CONFIGURE** will bring up kernel configurator otherwise kernel will be compiled with script presets located in lib/config/linux-*.config
- **KERNEL_CLEAN** executes "MAKE clean" on sources before compilation.
- **USEALLCORES** is here to tweak host CPU power consumption
- **BUILD_DESKTOP** is an experimental feature to build a desktop on the top of the system with hw acceleration for some boards.
- **AFTERINSTALL** is a variable with command executed in a process of building just before closing image to insert some of your custom applications or fixes.
- **KERNELTAG** is a TAG for specific kernel source. Some sources doesn't have that.
- **UBOOTTAG** is a TAG for specific u-boot source. Some sources doesn't have that.
- **FBTFT** is a [driver for small displays](https://github.com/notro/fbtft). Only applicable for old kernels (3.4-3.14)
- **EXTERNAL** compiles custom drivers
- **FORCE** ignore manual changes to source

## Creating compile environment ##

At first run we are downloading all necessary dependencies. Those packets are going to be installed:

	device-tree-compiler pv bc lzop zip binfmt-support bison build-essential ccache debootstrap 
	flex gawk gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf lvm2 qemu-user-static u-boot-tools uuid-dev zlib1g-dev unzip
	libusb-1.0-0-dev parted pkg-config expect gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi libncurses5-dev


## Using board configuration ##

We need to get some predefined variables about selected board. Which kernel & uboot source to use, modules to load, which is the build number, do we need to have a single partition or dual with boot on fat, which extra drivers to compile out of the kernel tree, ...

**Board configuration example:**
    
	REVISION="1.1"												# Version number is altered by board maintainer
	BOOTSIZE="16"												# Size of FAT boot partition. If not defined it's not used.
	BOOTLOADER="https://github.com/UDOOboard/uboot-imx"			# Uboot source location
	BOOTSOURCE="u-boot-neo"										# Local folder where to download it
	BOOTCONFIG="udoo_neo_config"								# Which compile config to use
	CPUMIN="198000"												# CPU minimum frequency
	CPUMAX="996000"												# CPU minimum frequency
	MODULES="bonding"											# old kernel modules
	MODULES_NEXT=""												# new kernel modules
	LINUXKERNEL="https://github.com/UDOOboard/linux_kernel"		# kernel source location
	LINUXCONFIG="linux-udoo-neo"								# kernel configuration
	LINUXSOURCE="linux-neo"										# Local folder where to download it

This **isn't ment to be user configurable** but you can alter variables if you really know what you are doing.

## Downloading sources ##

When we know where are the sources and where they need to be the download / update process starts. This might take from several minutes to several hours.

## Patching ##

In patching process we are appling patches to sources. The process is defined in:

	lib/patching.sh

## Compiling or choosing from cache ##


- compile from scratch with additional source cleaning and menu config.
- select cached / already made kernel 

## Debootstrap ##

Debootstrap creates fresh Debian / Ubuntu root filesystem templates or use cached under:

	output/rootfs/$DISTRIBUTION.tgz

To recreate those files you need to remove them manually. 

Those packets are installed on the top of basic system. There are some small differences between distributions:

	alsa-utils automake btrfs-tools bash-completion bc bridge-utils bluez build-essential cmake 
	cpufrequtils curl device-tree-compiler dosfstools evtest figlet fbset fping git haveged hddtemp
	hdparm hostapd htop i2c-tools ifenslave-2.6 iperf ir-keytable iotop iw less libbluetooth-dev
	libbluetooth3 libtool libwrap0-dev libfuse2 libssl-dev lirc lsof makedev module-init-tools mtp
	tools nano ntfs-3g ntp parted pkg-config pciutils pv python-smbus rfkill rsync screen stress 
	sudo sysfsutils toilet u-boot-tools unattended-upgrades unzip usbutils vlan wireless-tools wget wpasupplicant

## Kernel install ##

When root filesystem is ready we need to instal kernel image with modules, board definitions, firmwares. Along with this we set the CPU frequency min/max, hostname, modules, network interfaces templates. Here is also the place to install headers and fix + native compile them on the way.

## Distribution fixes ##

Each distributin has it's own way of doing things:

- serial console
- different packets
- configuration locations

## Board fixes ##

Each board has their own tricks: **different device names, firmware loaders, configuration (de)compilers, hardware configurators**

## Desktop installation ##

You can build a desktop withing the image. Consider this feature as experimental. Hardware acceleration on Allwinner boards is working within kernel 3.4.x only.

## External applications ##

This place is reserved for custom applications. There is one example of application - USB redirector.

## Closing image ##

There is an option to add some extra commands just before closing an image which is also automaticaly shrink to it's actual size with some small reserve.

## SDK directory structure ##

It will be something like this:

    compile.sh				
	lib/bin/				blobs, firmwares, static compiled, bootsplash
    lib/config/				kernel, board, u-boot, hostapd, package list
    lib/documentation/		user and developers manual
	lib/patch/				collection of kernel and u-boot patches
	lib/scripts/			firstrun, arm hardware info, firmware loaders
	lib/LICENSE				licence description
	lib/README.md			quick manual
	lib/boards.sh			board specfic installation, kernel install, desktop install
	lib/common.sh			creates environment, compiles, shrink image
	lib/configuration.sh	boards presets - kernel source, config, modules, ...
	lib/deboostrap.sh		basic system template creation
	lib/distributions.sh	system specific installation and fixes
	lib/main.sh				user input and script calls
	lib/patching.sh			board and system dependend kernel & u-boot patch calls
	output/linux-sunxi		downloaded kernel source
	output/u-boot			downloaded u-boot source
	output/output/kernel	tar packed kernel, uboot, dtb and firmware debs
	output/output/rootfs	cache for root filesystem
	output/output/u-boot	deb packed uboot
	output/output/			zip packed RAW image
